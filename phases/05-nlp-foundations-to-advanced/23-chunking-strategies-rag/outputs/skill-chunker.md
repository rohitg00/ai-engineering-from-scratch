Given a corpus (document types, avg length, domain) and query distribution (factoid / analytical / multi-hop), output:

1. Strategy. Recursive / sentence / semantic / parent-document / late / contextual. Reason.
2. Chunk size. Token count. Reason tied to query type.
3. Overlap. Default 0; justify if >0.
4. Min/max enforcement. `min_tokens`, `max_tokens` guards.
5. Evaluation plan. Recall@5 on 50-query stratified eval set (factoid, analytical, multi-hop).

Refuse any chunking strategy without min/max chunk size enforcement. Refuse overlap above 20% without an ablation showing it helps. Flag semantic chunking recommendations without a min-token floor.
